- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for a tech-forward, digital look.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, to ensure readability and clarity for potentially long blocks of text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clear, minimalistic icons relevant to content type (e.g., calculator for math, brackets for code).
- Use a clean, sectioned layout with clear headings and defined boxes to highlight key information.
- Subtle animations for loading and transitions to provide a smooth user experience.
